### Struct
* Structs are value types allocated either on the stack or inline in containing types.
* Allocations and de-allocations of value types are,
 in general, cheaper than allocations and de-allocations of reference types.
* In structs, each variable contains its own copy of the data 
  and an operation on one variable does not affect another variable.
 
### Classes
* Classes are reference types, allocated on the heap and garbage-collected.
* Assignments of large reference types are cheaper than assignments of large value types.
* In classes, two variables can contain the reference of 
  the same object, and any operation on one variable can affect another variable.
